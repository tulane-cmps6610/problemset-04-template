# CMPS 6610 Problem Set 04

In this assignment we'll look at the greedy and dynamic programming paradigms.

**To make grading easier, please place all written solutions directly in `answers.md`, rather than scanning in handwritten work or editing this file.**

All coding portions should go in `main.py` as usual.


## Part 1: Fixed-Length vs. Variable-Length Codes

You saw the Huffman coding algorithm for data compresssion in our
course materials. Let's implement the algorithm and look at its
empirical performance on a dataset of 5 text files.

**1a)** Already implemented is a means to compute character frequencies
  in a text file with the function `get_frequencies` in
  `main.py`. Compute cost for a fixed length encoding for each text
  file.

**1b)** Complete the implementation of Huffman coding in
  `make_huffman_tree`. Note that we manipulate binary trees in the
  priority queue using the object `TreeNode`. Moreover, once the tree
  is constructed, we must compute the actual encodings by traversing
  the Huffman tree that has been constructed. To do this, complete the
  implementation of `get_code`, which is a typical recursive binary
  tree traversal. That is, given a tree node, we recursively visit the
  left and right subtrees, appending a `0` or `1` to the encoding in
  each direction as appropriate. If we visit a leaf of the tree (which
  represents a character in the alphabet) we store the
  collected encoding for that character in `code`.

**1c)** Now implement `huffman_cost` to compute the cost of a Huffman
  encoding for a character set with given frequencies.

**1d)** Test your implementation of Huffman coding on the 5 given text
files, and fill out a table of the encoding cost of each file for
fixed-length and Huffman. Fill out a final column which gives the
ratio of Huffman coding cost to fixed-length coding cost. Do you see a
consistent trend? If so, what is it?

**1d)** Suppose that we used Huffman coding on a document with alphabet $\Sigma$ in
  which every character had the same frequency. What is the expected
  cost of a Huffman encoding for the document? Is it consistent across
  documents?

## Part 2: Making Change

Now that the pandemic is over and you decide to take a much needed vacation. You arrive in a city called Geometrica, and head to the bank to
exchange $N$ dollars for local currency. In Geometrica they have a
currency that is 1-1 with U.S. Dollars, but they only have
coins. Moreover the coins are in
denominations of powers of $2$ (e.g., $k$ denominations of values $2^0$, $2^1$, \ldots,
$2^k$). You wonder why they have
such strange denominations. You think about it a while, and because
you had such a good Algorithms instructor, you realize that there is a
very clever reason. 

**2a)** Given a $N$ dollars, state a greedy algorithm for producing
as few coins as possible that sum to $N$.

**2b)** Prove that this algorithm is optimal by proving the greedy
  choice and optimal substructure properties.

**enter answer in `answers.md`**


**2c)** What is the work and span of your algorithm?

## Part 3: Making Change Again

You get tired of Geometrica and travel to the nearby town of
Fortuito. While Fortuito also has a 1-1 exchange rate to the US
Dollar, it has an even stranger system of currency where any given bank
has a completely arbitrary set of denominations ($k$ denominations of
values $D_0, D_2, \ldots, D_k$). There is no guarantee that you can
even make change. So you wonder, given $N$ dollars is it possible to
even make change? If so, how can it be done with as few coins as
possible?

**2a)** You realize the greedy algorithm you devised above doesn't
  work in Fortuito. Give a simple counterexample that shows that the
  greedy algorithm does not produce the fewest number of coins.

**2b)** Since you paid attention in Algorithms class, you realize that
  while this problem does not have the greedy choice property it does
  have an optimal substructure property. State and prove this
  property.

**enter answer in `answers.md`**


**2c)** Use this optimal substructure property to design a
  dynamic programming algorithm for this problem. If you used top-down
  or bottom-up memoization to avoid recomputing solutions to
  subproblems, what is the work and span of your approach?

## Part 4: Edit Distance

In class we proved an optimal substructure property for the **Edit
Distance** problem. This allowed us to implement a simple recursive
algorithm in Python that was horribly inefficient. We're going to
implement a different version of edit distance that includes
substitutions, develop a top-down memoization scheme
and then implement a way to visualize the optimal sequence of edits.


**4a)** The code for `MED` from the course materials is provided as a
  starting point in `main.py.` We will consider a slightly different
  version of the edit distance problem which allows for insertions,
  deletions and substitutions. We will assume that insertions,
  deletions and substitutions all have the same unit cost. State the
  optimal substructure property for this version of the edit distance problem and modify `MED` accordingly. 


**4b)** Now implement `fast_MED`, a **top-down**
  memoized version of `MED`. Test your implementation code using `test_MED`.


**4c)** Now that you have implemented an efficient algorithm for
  computing edit distance, let's turn to the problem of identifying
  the actual edits between two sequences.

 Notice that in the process of computing the optimal edit
  distance, we can also keep track of the actual sequence of edits to
  each position of $S$ and $T$. Update your implementation of `fast_MED` to
  return the optimal edit distance as well as an *alignment* of the
  two strings which show the edits that yield this distance. An
  alignment just shows what changes are made to $S$ to transform it to
  $T$. For example, suppose $S$=`relevant` and $T$=`elephant`. If
  insertion, deletion and substitution costs are all equal to $1$, then the
  edit distance between $S$ and $T$ is 3 and an
  alignment of these two strings would look like this:

  `relev-ant`\
  `-elephant`

Implement `fast_align_MED` to return the aligned versions of $S$ and $T$,
and test your code with `test_alignment`.
